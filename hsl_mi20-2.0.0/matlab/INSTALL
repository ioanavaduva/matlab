-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Requirements
-----------------------------------------------------------------

These instructions are for linux-based systems (both 32-bit and 64-bit machines
are supported).

Requirements:
 - A recent version of Matlab
   (tested against 2009a, 2009b, 2010a, 2010b, 2011a, 2011b).
 - The supported C and Fortran compilers for your version of Matlab
   (g95 compiler for versions prior to 2011a, gfortran thereafter).
 - The MATLAB environment variable must point to your system matlab directory.
   From within Matlab, you can check where the environment variable points to
   by typing
       MATLAB
   If it is not pointing to the right location, then
   you can reset it by typing
       MATLAB = matlabpath
   where matlabpath is replaced by the path where Matlab is installed, for
   example,
       MATLAB = '/usr/local/matlab/'

-----------------------------------------------------------------
2. Directory structure
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The directory matlab obtained after extracting the archive contains all the
codes necessary for the installation and use of the MATLAB interface for
HSL_MI20.

The files in the matlab directory are:

INSTALL                 Installation instructions
README                  Instructions for using the interface
hsl_mi20_install.m      Matlab code for installing HSL_MI20 and interface
hsl_mi20_install.output Sample output from running hsl_mi20_install.m
hsl_mi20_test.m         Simple Matlab test example
hsl_mi20_full_test.m    Matlab test code aimed at fully exercising the interface
hsl_mi20_finalize.m     Matlab code for interface
hsl_mi20_control.m      Matlab code for interface
hsl_mi20_precondition.m Matlab code for interface
hsl_mi20_startup.m      Matlab code for interface
hsl_mi20_setup.m        Matlab code for interface
hsl_matlab.F90          Generic Fortran code for HSL Matlab interfaces
hsl_mi20.F90            Fortran code for Matlab interface

3. Installation of hsl_mi20 and its Matlab interface
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- Extract the hsl_mi20 archive into the desired directory.
- Start matlab
- Navigate to the directory containing the extracted files
- To install the interface, use the function HSL_MI20_INSTALL as follows.

    hsl_mi20_install() installs hsl_mi20 and its Matlab Interface. It is
       assumed that the BLAS and LAPACK routines provided by MATLAB
       are used, and mex is configured to use your preferred compiler.
       The test example is not run.

    hsl_mi20_install(TEST) installs hsl_mi20 and its Matlab Interface and
       optionally runs the test example. It is assumed that the BLAS and LAPACK
       routines provided with the interface are used, and mex is configured to
       use your preferred compiler.
       If TEST <= 0, the test example is not run;
       if TEST > 0, the test example is run and the user can compare the output
       with that of the file OUT/install.output. Note that there may be very
       small differences because of the arithmetic differing on different
       computers.

    hsl_mi20_install(TEST,LIBS) installs hsl_mi20 and its Matlab Interface
       and optionally runs the test example. It is assumed that mex is
       configured to use your preferred compiler.
       If LIBS has the value 'matlab' this is equivalent to the
         setting LIBS='-mwlapack -mwblas'. Use of this option on a 64-bit
         platform will force use of 64-bit default integers and may impede
         the performance of the HSL code.
       Otherwise LIBS should be set to specify which BLAS to link against, and
         may optionally specify the location of other libraries (eg libf95.a
         libgcc.a if they are not on a default search path). Typically
         this will take the form of LIBS='-L/path/to/blas -lblas'.

    hsl_mi20_install(TEST,LIBS,MEXFLAGS) installs hsl_mi20 and its Matlab
       Interface and optionally runs the test example. The contents of the
       variable MEXFLAGS is passed to mex as follows.
         mex $(MEXFLAGS) -c file.F90
         mex $(MEXFLAGS) $(LIBS) -output foo.mex file.F90
      If MEXFLAGS is not supplied it assumes the default value of
        '-largeArrayDims' on a 64-bit platform and is empty on a 32-bit
        platform.
      If MEXFLAGS is supplied and BLAS='matlab' on a 64-bit machine, the user
        must ensure that the relevant flag to force 64-bit default integers is
        passed to the compiler by explictly setting FFLAGS='-i8 -fPIC' (g95) or
        '-fdefault-real-8 -fPIC' (gfortran). (The -fPIC is needed as the mex
        default value of FFLAGS uses -fPIC to create a shared library).
