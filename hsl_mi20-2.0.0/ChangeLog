Version 2.0.0
 * Added support for using hsl_mi20 as a solver by including the mi20_solve
   routine.
 * Moved to new interfaces for different data types: mi20_setup_csr,
   mi20_setup_csc, mi20_setup_coord. Old mi20_setup interface still more
   efficient (in Fortran, not in C), but future plans will see this change.
 * MATLAB support improved to allow more than one instance of the
   preconditioner to be used at a time. The old pre 1.4.0 interface interface
   (previously deprecated) has now been removed entirely.

Version 1.5.1 Fix Matlab installer bug so it now works with version 2012b.

Version 1.5.0 Add C interface.

Version 1.4.0 Update matlab interface to use handles.
Old matlab interface would require significant revision each time HSL_MA48
changed internal data formats, new one doesn't.
Also migrate to new hsl_matlab to make it possible to use gfortran and both
integer*4 and integer*8.
Also remove a stray non-conforming tab character from main source file.

Version 1.3.1
Work around potential compiler bug by replacing array slice notation
with do loops for several large copies.

2010-03-19
Version 1.3.0 Bug fixed in MI20_precondition
(several copies did not specify part of array to copy so could try
and copy unassigned entries)

2010-02-08
Version 1.2.0
Components of mi20_keep made public for use within hsl_mi20 matlab interface

2008-03-04
Version 1.1.2  Several lines > 80 reflowed with &s

2007-11-01
Version 1.1.1. Changed default for control%damping to 0.8
(on advice from Milan).

2007-10-17
Version 1.1.0
Added additional parameter control%reduction that allows the
coarsening to terminate if the reduction in size of successive
grids is too small.
